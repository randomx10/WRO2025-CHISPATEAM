<p>
In this directory, you will find the 3D printed components that were essential to the design and functionality of our robot. These pieces were specifically created to optimize vision and structural support while keeping the overall weight of the robot low and ensuring precise alignment of key systems.

      <b>Limelight Mount</b><br>
      One of the most important printed pieces is the mount for the Limelight camera. We designed it to keep the vision system stable and in the right position to detect the traffic signals and track targets efficiently. The angle was carefully adjusted to increase field of view and reduce blind spots. Itâ€™s lightweight but solid enough to hold the camera steady, even during fast movements. This improvement helped us gain more accuracy and align much better with our objectives.

      <b>Top Chassis Support</b><br>
      This structural support is placed on the top part of the chassis and was designed to hold sensors, wiring, and additional modules in place. One of the main goals was to improve the internal layout of the robot, keeping everything organized and making maintenance easier. It also adds an extra layer of protection to the internal electronics. This part was printed using strong filament to ensure rigidity and durability, without affecting the balance of the robot.
