## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges During Development

Like any real-world project, we faced several challenges that pushed us to adapt, learn quickly, and find creative solutions. Here are some of the main issues we had to overcome:

- **LiDAR connection problems:** At the beginning, we couldn‚Äôt get the LiDAR to connect properly with our system. It took us a while to understand the communication protocol and configure it correctly so it would respond as expected.

- **Inaccurate data:** Even after establishing the connection, the data we received from the LiDAR was imprecise and unreliable. We had to tweak the reading filters and run several tests until we got stable and useful measurements.

- **Track border size issues:** We noticed that the track borders were 1 cm smaller than expected. This affected how our robot detected edges and navigated the course, so we decided to increase the borders by 1 cm to match the official measurements and avoid errors.

- **3D part adjustments:** We had to redesign a 3D-printed part that holds the LiDAR sensor. It needed to have just the right height so the LiDAR could rotate freely without hitting other components. This took some trial and error until we got it just right.

- **Camera configuration and lighting:** Object detection didn‚Äôt work well at first. We had to adjust settings like exposure and white balance, since lighting conditions were messing up the color and shape recognition. Proper calibration made a big difference.
